# Decisions

This document records foundational decisions for this repository.
Changing anything here requires a deliberate reason.

## Language
Python is the default language.

Reason:
- Strong ecosystem
- Excellent backend and tooling support
- Fast iteration speed
- Suitable for APIs, tooling, and applied research

## Python Version
Python 3.12+

Reason:
- Current stable baseline
- Better performance and typing improvements
- Forces modern syntax and libraries

## Project Type Assumption
Default assumption is a backend or local application, not frontend-heavy UI.

Reason:
- Aligns with my strengths and long-term goals
- Frontends are added only when explicitly needed
