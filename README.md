# startup-base

This repository defines my personal, opinionated baseline for starting new software projects.

It is not a product template. It is a living standard that captures how I structure projects, manage dependencies, enforce quality, and ship software using modern tools and practices.

Every new project starts by forking this repository and then adapting it intentionally.

## What this repo is for
- Consistent project structure
- Modern tooling defaults
- Clear development workflows
- Built-in quality gates (linting, testing, CI)
- Documented decisions to avoid regressions over time

## What this repo is not
- A finished application
- A framework
- A one-size-fits-all solution

## How to use
1. Fork this repository.
2. Rename the project and update this README.
3. Remove anything that does not apply.
4. Build your product on top of these defaults.

## Philosophy
Defaults matter. This repository exists to make good practices automatic and bad practices inconvenient.
